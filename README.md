# CSE 219

Assorted homework assignments from CSE 219 from Spring 2012. Not included are the [final project](https://github.com/yvds/ramble-on), and the [Software Design Document](https://github.com/yvds/219s14-ReviewSession).

Current students are welcome to view my code to aquaint themselves, but please do not use it for your own assignments! It's immoral, the frameworks change every year, and I didn't get a perfect score on some of these! :)
