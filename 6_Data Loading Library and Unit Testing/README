Fixed images, and realized I needed to add method calls!!

Made set of methods. Will need to test, and then figure out what the heck JUnit is.

The error was with the simple things! Now, to wonder how to implement the other needed components in the most efficient and useful way.

Still wondering the mechanics of specific choosing for gameplay.

Making the IO for the XML data. Wondering how the file searching for additional information and location of the XML file will work out.

Hoping commiting will clear up the weird color this project just turned!

Adding subdirectory boolean for ease in later programming.

Note to self: declaring objects saves you hours of agony and the shame of making silly mistakes.
c602fcdfd0865fa9363fd9a0de8234a161c50910	Apr 21, 2013 12:43:31 PM	yv <yv@Veda>
Going to try a mini-test to see what works so far!

Added methods for game reset, can be initialized without initial name for more functionality.

Saving seems useless at the moment. May add later if needed, but right now, not a priority.
bb73a4d5c604a05ad043c3af64fd1db9a65ffcd2	Apr 20, 2013 5:13:51 PM	yv <yv@Veda>
Removed Region object for consolidation. All gameplay information is contained in GameDataManager. GDM also holds information about the map and winning audio, though implementation is not a top priority at the moment.
325a01b3120a27ab8a4ce058bcbe6df4bbc314c8	Apr 20, 2013 5:07:39 PM	yv <yv@Veda>
Wondering if a main Region node is ideal or needed, given the lack of large-scale tree as per HW #2. (To do so would eat up a lot of time and memory, and would be silly.)
506ec17aca276a3aaa7dfac37bca78f4122a8f3e	Apr 20, 2013 4:31:19 PM	yv <yv@Veda>
This contains the information for a completed region for use in the game. It will be independent of the XML import features to allow for better organization, and possible changes on the import/data storage in general.

RambleOnXMLData [ad hoc testing class, not included]

It works! Now to figure out JUnit...

Going to test again!

Program will completely stop when encountering bad data, but will not crash! Need to find a way to make it continue.

Ready for more testing!

Testing exceptions again.

Trying to see why image/flag object values are null. Exception thrown/file not found, or unable to print data in string?

Tested ability to get name and colors sucessfully!
cbf9c3fe9fdc3f168dfed9da5446faf45c8c3566	Apr 21, 2013 12:44:31 PM	yv <yv@Veda>
Test program for working! Will eventually become the main driver until final game implementation.
